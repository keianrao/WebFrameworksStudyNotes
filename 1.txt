	- 388MB is for project-local node_modules. Contains 1002 dependencies
	- Already added in .gitignore. Which is following ember project structure
- `ember server` to spawn a quick web server
- Quick web server has live reload. Reacts to file changes with recompilation
	- "and refreshes any open browser pages." Um, how does it..?
	
- Template file extension is 'hbs'.
- Template file can work just like HTML, except everything is implicitly in a <body> tag (No need to write HTML header, so on).

[Angular]
- Angular is an entire platform, containing more than a framework.
- It is all TypeScript-based.

- Angular components are typescript classes decorated with @Component().
- In the source code, the decorator is not small (like "@Component(Atom)"),
  rather it is passed a whole JavaScript object. So it will typically be
  multi-line.
  
- Decorator specifies CSS selector. All HTML elements in the template
  matching the selector will be deemed an instance of the component.
- Decorator also specifies template for component, either a filepath or
  inline as a JavaScript string.
- Angular templates are like HTML, except custom tags can be used -
  when they match the CSS selector in the decorator, its contents are
  filled - 'rendering' - using the template in the decorator.
  
- Templates also support dynamic values, variables from the component class.
  When the instance is updated the rendered DOM automatically changes.
- Templates have more features. The resulting syntax makes use of a
  decent amount of special characters..
  
  
- Angular has native support for dependency injection.
  @Injectable({providedIn: 'root'}) registers a class. Then any constructor
  in other classes asking for that type can get injected with an instance.
